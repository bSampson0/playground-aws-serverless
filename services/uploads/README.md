# uploads

This service uses the open source tool [ClamAV](https://clamav.net) to get the latest virus definition files and to scan new/updated files.

The service:

- downloads the latest virus definition files and uploads them to the S3 bucket CLAMAV_BUCKET_NAME
- scans all files that are uploaded/updated to the User Attachments bucket
- tags each scanned file with scanned status
